## Tools
### Colorizer
This tool allows the automatic introduction of a gradient to any text in TRP3. The gradient can be applied left-to-right, right-to-left, or symmetrically (left-to-right to half the text, right-to-left to the other half).

#### Usage
Run it online [here](https://www.online-python.com/ZSCNOiuDVe)!

### Custom Fonts
Not a tool, but a resource. Some of the fonts (but not all) which can be found [here](https://lingojam.com/CoolTextFonts) are also usable in TRP3. Most will require a special rectangular box character preceding the special font to work, but you can hide this character by color-matching the TRP3 background color (I recommend solid black).

#### Usage
I recommend pasting the font you want into a new TRP3 profile. Otherwise, back up the contents of your TRP3 profile before pasting into an existing one, as the formatting can break with the easiest resolution being a full clear (Ctrl+A to highlight all text, then backspace).

### Deformatter
This tool allows the removal of TRP3 formatting. This can be useful if you have a lot of formatting but want to get the raw text of your TRP3 profile for pasting in another format (e.g. online, in Discord, wherever).

#### Usage
You can run the code by pasting your TRP3 contents into the `STRING` variable, or by running the code on a text file containing your TRP3 contents with `FILE_PATH` pointing to the file location.

Run it online [here](https://www.online-python.com/xsLyMt80gw) (only for the `STRING` method).
